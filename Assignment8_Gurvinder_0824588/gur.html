                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Shimla's history unfolds as a captivating narrative that spans centuries and reflects diverse influences. Originally named Shyamala after the Hindu goddess, the area was transformed during the British colonial era when it emerged as a cool retreat from the plains' heat. Recognizing its potential, the British established Shimla as the summer capital in 1864, leading to the construction of colonial-style structures, including the iconic Viceregal Lodge and Christ Church. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, built in the late 19th century, added to the city's charm and accessibility, earning it recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Post-independence, Shimla became the capital of Himachal Pradesh in 1966. Beyond its political significance, Shimla has evolved into a popular tourist destination, preserving its colonial architecture, such as the Ridge and Gaiety Theatre, and embracing cultural institutions like the Indian Institute of Advanced Study.</p>
